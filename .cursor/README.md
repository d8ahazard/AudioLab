# .cursor Directory for AudioLab

This directory contains configuration and documentation files designed to help AI assistants better understand and interact with the AudioLab project. These files serve as context and guidance to ensure that AI assistance remains focused on specific tasks and maintains a clear understanding of the project's architecture.

## Directory Contents

- **settings.json**: Configuration settings for Cursor and AI assistants, defining the project structure, feature modules, and common error patterns.
- **project_structure.md**: High-level overview of the AudioLab project structure and directory organization.
- **module_dependencies.md**: Documentation of relationships and dependencies between different modules in the project.
- **coding_conventions.md**: Coding style guidelines and best practices for the AudioLab project.
- **feature_models.md**: Summary of the key features, AI models, and technologies used in each module.
- **troubleshooting.md**: Common troubleshooting approaches for diagnosing and fixing issues in the project.
- **README.md**: This file, explaining the purpose of the .cursor directory.

## Purpose

These files are intended to provide AI assistants with:

1. **Consistent Context**: Ensuring all AI assistants have the same understanding of the project structure and architecture.
2. **Focused Problem-Solving**: Helping to identify the relevant parts of the codebase when addressing specific issues.
3. **Code Pattern Recognition**: Documenting common patterns and conventions used throughout the project.
4. **Dependency Awareness**: Clarifying how different modules interact and depend on each other.
5. **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Providing structured approaches to diagnose and fix common issues.

## Usage

When working with an AI assistant on the AudioLab project:

1. The AI assistant should refer to these files to understand the project context.
2. When addressing specific issues, the AI should first consult the relevant sections in these files.
3. For troubleshooting, the AI should follow the guidance in troubleshooting.md.
4. When suggesting changes, the AI should adhere to the conventions described in coding_conventions.md.

## Maintenance

These files should be updated when significant changes are made to the project structure or when new modules or features are added. This ensures that AI assistants always have the most up-to-date understanding of the project.
